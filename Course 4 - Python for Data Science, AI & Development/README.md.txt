Course 4: Python for Data Science, AI & Development

About this course:
Python is one of the most popular languages in the programming and data science world and demand for individuals who have the ability to apply Python has never been higher.  

This course will describe about Python basics and the different data types, with Python Data structures like List and Tuples, as well as logic concepts like conditions and branching. Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy & Beautiful Soup will be used along with tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs.

Jupyter Notebooks and Microsoft Visual Studio Code are used in this course and project. From Extension in VSCode, please download necessary extensions for Python and Jupyter.

Module 1:
This module describes the basics of Python and begins by exploring some of the different data types such as integers, real numbers, strings, learn how to use expressions in mathematical operations, store values in variables, and the many different ways to manipulate strings.

Topics Covered:
* Expressions & Variables
* String Operations

Objectives: 
* Demonstrate an understanding of types in Python by converting or casting data types such as strings, floats, and integers.
* Interpret variables and solve expressions by applying mathematical operations.
* Describe how to manipulate strings by using a variety of methods and operations.
* Build a program in JupyterLab to demonstrate your knowledge of types, expressions, and variables.
* Work with, manipulate, and perform operations on strings in Python.

Module 2:
This module describes Python data structures by explaining the use of lists and tuples and how they are able to store collections of data in a single variable. Also functionalities of dictionaries and how they function by storing data in pairs of keys and values, and Python sets that can appear in any order and will only contain unique elements.

Objectives: 
* Describe and manipulate tuple combinations and list data structures.
* Execute basic tuple operations in Python.
* Perform list operations in Python.
* Write structures with correct keys and values to demonstrate understanding of dictionaries.
* Work with and perform operations on dictionaries in Python.
* Create sets to demonstrate understanding of the differences between sets, tuples, and lists.
* Work with sets in Python, including operations and logic operations.

Topics Covered:
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets

Module 3:
This module discusses Python fundamentals, the concepts of conditions and branching, how to implement loops to iterate over sequences, create functions to perform a specific task, perform exception handling to catch errors, and how classes are needed to create objects.

Objectives:
* Classify conditions and branching by identifying structured scenarios with outputs.
* Work with objects and classes.
* Explain objects and classes by identifying data types and creating a class.
* Use exception handling in Python.
* Explain what functions do.
* Build a function using inputs and outputs.
* Explain how for loops and while loops work.
* Work with condition statements in Python, including operators and branching.
* Create and use loop statements in Python.

Topics Covered:
* Conditions & Branching
* Loops
* Functions
* Exception Handling
* Objects & Classes
* Text Analysis

Module 4:
This module explains the basics of working with data in Python, how to read and write files, and the Python libraries that will aid in data manipulation and mathematical operations.

Objectives: 
* Explain how Pandas use data frames.
* Use Pandas library for data analysis.
* Read text files using Python libraries including "open" and "with".
* Utilize NumPy to create one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
* Write and save files in Python.

Topics Covered:
* Read-Write files with Open
* Selecting data in a DataFrame
* Loading data with Pandas
* One/Two Dimensional NumPy
