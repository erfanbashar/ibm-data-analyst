Course 3 - Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel and Cognos:

About this course: 

This course is about how to create data visualizations and dashboards using spreadsheets and analytics tools. It covers some of the first steps for telling a compelling story with data using various types of charts and graphs.  

Starting from creating simple charts in Excel such as line, pie and bar charts, to creating more advanced visualizations with Treemaps, Scatter Charts, Histograms, Filled Map Charts, and Sparklines, this course also describes with the Excel PivotChart feature as well as assemble several visualizations in an Excel dashboard.

This course also covers how to use business intelligence (BI) tools like Cognos Analytics to create interactive dashboards. The final project is to create a set of data visualizations and an interactive dashboard.

Module 4:

Create visualizations for the following captured KPI metrics:

The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/?context=analytics&type=Data&product=Cognos%20Analytics&industry=Automotive in the IBM Accelerator Catalog. The Terms of use for such are located at https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/.

TASK 1: Quantity Sold by Dealer ID - as a bar chart, sorted in either ascending or descending order of quantity sold, and change the chart title to Quantity Sold by Dealer ID

TASK 2: Profit by Date and Model - as a line chart, and give the chart a title of Profit by Date and Model

TASK 3: Profit by Year and Dealer ID - as a column chart, titled Profit by Year and Dealer ID with the data columns in red

TASK 4: Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID - as a line chart, titled Profit of Hudson Models by Dealer ID. Also remove the horizontal gridlines from the chart, put the legend on the right side of the chart, and color the series outline in green.

TASK 5: Save completed workbook as CarSalesByModelEnd.xlsx

Creating Visualizations Using Cognos Analytics:

The dataset used in this lab comes from the IBM Accelerator Catalog. The Terms of use for such are located at https://developer.ibm.com/terms/ibm-developer-terms-of-use/.

* Task 1: Create two dashboards as follows - One dashboard using the tabbed template that has 4 small rectangles at the top and a large rectangle below - rename this dashboard tab to Sales. One dashboard using the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template - rename this dashboard tab to Service.

* Task 2: Capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
	* On the Sales dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics:
		* In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars)
		* In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), capture Quantity sold
		* In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capture Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart)
		* In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold
* Task 3: On the Sales dashboard in the large rectangle (Panel 5), display Profit by Dealer ID as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.
* Task 4: On the Service dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:
	* In the top left area (Panel 1), capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart)
	* In the top right area (Panel 2), capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap)
	* In the bottom left area (Panel 3), capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
	* In the bottom right area (Panel 4), capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.
