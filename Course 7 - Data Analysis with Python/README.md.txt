Course 7: Data Analysis with Python

About this Course: 
Analyzing data with Python is an essential skill for Data Scientists and Data Analysts. This course will cover from the basics of data analysis with Python to building and evaluating data models.

Topics:  
* collecting and importing data 
* cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
* data frame manipulation 
* summarizing data 
* building machine learning regression models 
* model refinement 
* creating data pipelines 

It briefly describes how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations. Afterwards, predict future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and how to evaluate them.

Several open source Python libraries, including Pandas and Numpy to load, manipulate, analyze, and visualize cool datasets are used. Also used scipy and scikit-learn, to build machine learning models and make predictions.

Module 1:

This module will describe how to understand data and how to use the libraries in Python to import data from multiple sources. You will then learn how to perform some basic tasks to start exploring and analyzing the imported data set.

Objectives:
* Access databases using Python database APIs
* Analyze Python data using a dataset
* Identify three Python libraries and describe their uses
* Read data using Python's Pandas package
* Demonstrate how to import and export data in Python

Module 6:

This module describes how a given dataset containing detailed information about house prices in the region based on a number of property features can be analyzed and predict the market price of houses given that information.

Objectives: 
* Write Python code to import data sets into a data frame
* Generate appropriate Python code to wrangle data
* Create boxplots and scatter plots using Python
* Calculate R-squared and MSE using Python
* Evaluate different data models by splitting data into training and testing sets
* Perform polynomial transformation on data sets
