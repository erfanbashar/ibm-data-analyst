Course 6 - Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python:

About this course:
Working knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a must for data professionals like Data Scientists, Data Analysts and Data Engineers. Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL is a powerful language used for communicating with and extracting data from databases.

This course covers SQL inside out- from the very basics of Select statements to advanced concepts like JOINs.

Objective: 
* write foundational SQL statements like: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE 
* filter result sets, use WHERE, COUNT, DISTINCT, and LIMIT clauses 
* differentiate between DML & DDL 
* CREATE, ALTER, DROP and load tables 
* use string patterns and ranges; ORDER and GROUP result sets, and built-in database functions
* build sub-queries and query data from multiple tables 
* access databases as a data scientist using Jupyter notebooks with SQL and Python
* work with advanced concepts like Stored Procedures, Views, ACID Transactions, Inner & Outer JOINs through hands-on labs and projects

Module 4:

This module introduces the basic concepts of using Python to connect to databases. It covers the topics - create tables, load data, query data using SQL magic and SQLite python library, and how to analyze data using Python.

Objectives:
* Access databases from Python using SQL magic
* Describe concepts related to accessing Databases using Python
* Create tables and insert data using Python
* Analyze a data set using SQL and Python

Note: Execute pip install ipython-sql if %sql is not supported.

Module 5:

This module will introduce working with multiple real-world datasets for the city of Chicago. There will be asked questions that will help to understand the data. The correctness of SQL queries and results will be assessed.

Objectives: 
* Discuss real-world datasets
* Analyze table details and properties
* Interpret and translate data analysis questions into SQL queries
* Run SQL queries on real world datasets
