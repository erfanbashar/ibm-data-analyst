Course 2 - Excel Basics for Data Analysis:

This course is designed to give a basic working knowledge of Excel and how to use it for analyzing data. 
 
This course provides valuable experience working with data sets and spreadsheets, starting from spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, and how to load data from multiple formats. From there, how to perform basic data wrangling and cleansing tasks using functions, and data analysis through the use of filtering, sorting, and pivot tables. 
 
There is a strong focus on practice and applied learning in this course with the opportunity to manipulate data and gain hands-on experience using Excel, how to clean and format your data efficiently, and convert it into a pivot table to make it more organized and readable. The final project allows to showcase newly acquired data analysis skills by working with real data sets and spreadsheets.

Module 5:

Task 1:

Clean and Prepare the Data

The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr under a Public Domain license.

In this project, the task is about importing some data from another department which relates to inventory information about their fleet of vehicles. The data is in comma-separated value (CSV) format and the data also needs cleaning up before starting to run any kind of analysis on it.

Task 2:

Analyze the Data

The dataset used in this lab comes from the following source: https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr under a Public Domain license.

In this project, the task is about sorting and analyzing fleet inventory data that was previously imported and cleaned. The plan is to use pivot tables to analyze the data in preparation for the results to be visualized in a dashboard and added to a data findings report later.
